"# All_things_data" 
# Below project is an analysis of effectiveness of campaigns applied to increase the number of active players

# It shows campaigns which achieved the biggest numbers of players, shows their retention overtime and discovers which were the
# most profitable

# Then, we discover in which countries campaigns reached the most players, where in the world players were more likely to pay
# or users of which platform were the most profitable ones


# Results are shown with various types of charts depending on the data that we want to show,
# The whole proces of data preparation is written using numpy and pandas libraries, data visualisation with matplotlib,
